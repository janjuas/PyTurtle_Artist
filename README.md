# PyTurtle_Artist
The Turtle artist program is inspired by Artist Damien Hirst's Dot Paintings and produces a 10x10 image of randomly colour circles.
The Colorgram module is used to generate a colour palette from a user provided image.
The end image is then generated with the generated colour palette. 
Each painting is unique as colours are chosen at random.
